      Most science content today is either made for the scientifically-curious (science YouTube, pop science, etc.), students (textbooks and study helps) or career scientists (academic journals). Many science enthusiasts find this content either too simple or too complex. Neutrino fills this gap, connecting science enthusiasts to content that is interactive and right-leveled. In Kellogg's core product management class, I came up with the idea for Neutrino, did customer interviews, and created requirements, culminating in a PRD and a pitch deck..

      I spent the majority of my undergrad majoring in Physics and Astronomy before switching to Applied Physics near the end (which allowed me to take more computer science courses), and I was deeply involved in that department as a student, teaching assistant, researcher, and club officer.

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8 first:mt-0 border-b border-gray-200 pb-2">Research Focus</h2>
    
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        My research focused on our ability to figure out how far away galaxies are. This is a difficult problem to solve, and is important when we try to understand how these galaxies formed (which also influences our understanding of dark matter). The standard way to measure galaxy distance is expensive and requires huge telescopes, which isn&apos;t feasible in most cases. We developed a new system that we believed would work on smaller telescopes at a fraction of the time and cost.
      </p>
    
    <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      For my contribution, I took archival data for hundreds of thousands of galaxies and simulated the data we would get if we observed those galaxies using our new filters (this is actually where I first learned SQL and Python). My results showed that we could find galaxy distance at 10x the accuracy of the next best low-cost method. As a result of this research, we invested to have the filters built and tested them out on real telescopes looking at real galaxies, and our observational results exactly matched the simulated results.

    <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      I also conducted physics education research. Our 100-level astronomy course relied on class projects to get students outside and looking at the night sky, but the projects were outdated and inflexible. I updated these projects to align more closely with modern technology and with course goals.

      Over the summer, I was a product manager intern for IDeaS Revenue Management Solutions, where I worked on four projects across the product development lifecycle: initial research, defining requirements, creating epics for developers, and running a pilot program with enterprise clients.

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">As a product management intern at IDeaS Revenue Solutions, a demand forecasting platform for hotels, I investigated years-old client feedback claiming that our software couldn&apos;t price meal plan add-ons effectively.</p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-3">Initial research suggested this was a non-issue. We had features for pricing add-ons, and no one had heard similar complaints. The prevailing theory was user error.</p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-3">I wasn&apos;t satisfied with this answer, so I mapped the complete user journey for setting up add-ons across different customer types. That&apos;s when I discovered the gap: hotels and all-inclusive resorts have vastly different revenue models, and we had built optimizations for each—but resorts with &quot;all-inclusive optional&quot; systems (common in EMEA) didn&apos;t fit either model. These customers were slipping through the cracks.</p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-3">I drafted a proposal for a third optimization strategy tailored to these hybrid resorts. The research revealed this would unlock 36% of the world&apos;s resorts we were currently unable to serve well, including a major enterprise client we were actively pitching.</p>

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8 first:mt-0 border-b border-gray-200 pb-2">Background</h2>
    <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">I'd like to preface that, above all, this is a joke.</p>
    <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">During a recent family reunion, someone jokingly asked the grandparents about their favorite grandchildren. We all laughed and moved on, but it got me wondering–if my grandparents had picked favorites, it would be pretty hard for them to keep track. They had their fair share of children and grandchildren (and now great-grandchildren), and their memory wasn't great near the end.</p>
    <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Thus, the idea was born: help grandparents stack-rank their children and grandchildren.</p>
    <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">When I asked myself why grandparents might want to do this, the answer was immediately obvious: so that they could weaponize their ranking to spend more quality time with their loved ones. Their primary Job-To-Be-Done was to have positive interactions with their children and grandchildren. If the best way to encourage these positive interactions was by pitting their posterity against each other in exchange for a larger inheritance, so be it.</p>
    
    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8 border-b border-gray-200 pb-2">Design Principles</h2>
    <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-3 mb-6">
      <li className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed pl-2">Feel real. Despite being a joke, Heirarchy shouldn't seem like one. This was entirely for my benefit–I think it's much funnier when it's subtle.</li>
      <li className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed pl-2">Zero onboarding friction. Visitors aren't looking for a heavy tool that they will invest time in–they're looking for a quick laugh from a fun website.</li>
      <li className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed pl-2">Zero budget. This was purely for fun, and I'm not paying any server resources.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8 border-b border-gray-200 pb-2">Who is my customer?</h2>
    <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">In actuality, Heirarchy is meant to be a joke. However, in accordance with my design principles, I built Heirarchy thinking about the hypothetical customers who will use it.</p>
    <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Heirarchy's ICP (under the assumption that this is not a joke) is US-based, aged 65+, has enough descendants to pit them against each other (3+), and is middle class or upper-middle class (enough assets that their posterity are interested in the inheritance, but not so wealthy that they are relying on trusts/more formal estate planning).</p>
    <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">My primary motivation for building Heirarchy was to have a fun project to work on. However, I also wanted to build a project that I could use to learn about the product development process.</p>
    <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">They're not particularly tech-savvy, but they spend time on Facebook (where they will share things they find humorous or interesting) and have basic proficiency with computers/smart phones. They also have either a good sense of humor, or are strongly opinionated and like to "tell it like it is."</p>
    <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">They love their children and grandchildren, and have a strong desire to spend more time with them.</p>  

    <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4 mt-8 border-b border-gray-200 pb-2">Decisions and Rationale</h2>
    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3 mt-6">Design</h3>
    <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-3 mb-6">
      <li className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed pl-2">There's no login, and everything is on one page. This aligns with my "Zero friction" design principle. Not only do I want actual users to get to the content immediately, I want my ICP to be able to see everything they need without difficult navigation–my experience with my grandparents is that they struggle with a hamburger menu, and spend most of their time searching the page they're on looking for what they want.</li>
      <li className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed pl-2">I developed this using free tools. GitHub Pages is hosting it (which is free). All memory and operations are client-side. This supports my "Zero budget" design principle.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3 mt-6">Features</h3>
    <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-3">
      <li className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed pl-2">I decided that, beyond ranking posterity, this had to include will generation. This is for two reasons. First, if it's just a ranking, it doesn't have nearly as much "teeth" motivating posterity to act. Second, this is a unique way to do estate planning, and other sources are not built for a division of wealth like this–I'm not able to point them to another source, particularly one that handles wills that change as regularly as these do.</li>
      <li className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed pl-2">The will that is generated is an actual, legal will. It needs to be filled out and notarized before it's binding, and users should consult with a lawyer before using it, but it can actually be used. The "Feel real" design principle demands that the site be completely functional.</li>
      <li className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed pl-2">The ranking is done by points, and points are generated through actions that can be taken by almost anyone and that are, theoretically, valued by my ICP (although, some of them are meant to be humorous). The primary goal of Heirarchy is to help users have more quality interactions with their posterity. I believe that is more successful if the ranking is objective and within the control of the individuals being ranked.</li>
      <li className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed pl-2">Users can download an image of their ranking that is optimized for sharing on social media. My ICP is active on Facebook, and I expect them to share their ranking there. This is essential to let their posterity know how they're doing, and it also is a path to organic, user-led growth.</li>
    </ol>
